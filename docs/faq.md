# Frequently Asked Questions

### Why does lip provide a daemon (`lipd`)?
The daemon (`lipd`) is designed for **external integrations**. It allows IDEs, GUIs, and other tools to interact with lip programmatically using a standard JSON-RPC interface.

**Note**: The standard `lip` CLI runs independently and **does not** use the daemon. This ensures the CLI remains simple and has zero startup overhead for standard operations.

### What is `tooth.json`?
`tooth.json` is the manifest file for a lip package. It defines the package's metadata (name, version, description), its dependencies, and how it should be installed on different platforms. Think of it like `package.json` for Node.js or `Cargo.toml` for Rust.

### Does `lip install` update `tooth.json`?
**No.** Running `lip install <package>` installs the package into your workspace and updates the lockfile (`tooth_lock.json`) to track the state, but it **does not** modify your `tooth.json` manifest. You must manually add dependencies to `tooth.json` if you want them to be permanent parts of your project's requirements.

### How do I upgrade lip itself?
Reinstall `lip` using the same method you used originally, such as `npm install -g @futrime/lip`, `winget upgrade futrime.lip`, or the latest Windows `setup.exe` from the GitHub releases page. There is no built-in `lip self-update` command yet.

### Does lip support private repositories?
Yes, lip can install packages from private Git repositories using your system's Git credentials (e.g., SSH keys or Credential Manager). It relies on the local Git environment for authentication.

### Where does lip store installed packages?
lip installs package files **directly into your workspace** based on the rules defined in `tooth.json`. Unlike some package managers, it does not isolate dependencies in a separate folder unless the package manifest explicitly specifies those locations.

The global cache is stored in your system's local application data directory (e.g., `%LOCALAPPDATA%\lip\cache` on Windows, or `~/.local/share/lip/cache` on Linux).
