# tooth.json

The `tooth.json` file defines a package's metadata, identifier, version, dependencies, files, and other configuration settings. This file must be in JSON format and located in the package's root directory.

For the complete JSON schema specification, see [tooth.v3.schema.json](../../schemas/tooth.v3.schema.json).

In the documentation below, fields are marked as either (required) or (optional). Note that if a parent field is optional but contains required child fields, those child fields become mandatory only if the parent field is included. For example, while `variants` is optional, if you include it, each variant must specify a `platform`.

Scriban expressions allow you to dynamically reference other fields within any string value, making package maintenance easier. For example, use `{{tooth}}` to reference the package's tooth path or `{{version}}` to access the package's version number. This dynamic referencing helps keep your package configurations DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and more maintainable. However, some package manifest manipulation commands (e.g. commands with `--save` option) may not support Scriban expressions.

## Fields

### format_version (required)

The format version number. Currently only version `3` is supported.

### format_uuid (required)

The format's unique identifier. Currently only `289f771f-2c9a-4d73-9f3f-8492495a924d` is supported.

### tooth (required)

The package's tooth path, a unique identifier in Go module path format (a URL without scheme and suffix).

Examples:

- `github.com/LiteLDev/LeviLamina`

Note: To publish a package, its tooth path must match the repository URL where it's hosted.

### version (required)

The package version in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) format.

Examples:

- `1.0.0`
- `1.0.0-alpha.1`
- `0.1.0`

When creating release tags, prefix versions with `v` (e.g., `v1.0.0`). However, omit the `v` prefix in the `version` field. Avoid using `v0.0.0` as Go module proxy treats it as a pseudo-version.

### info (optional)

Package metadata fields.

### info.name (optional)

The display name of the package.

### info.description (optional)

A brief description of the package.

### info.tags (optional)

Package tags in either of these formats:

- Simple tag: `tag`
- Key-value pair: `tag:subtag`

Tags and subtags may only contain lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens ([a-z0-9-]). While lip treats both formats equally, some platforms like [Bedrinth](https://bedrinth.com) may use them differently.

### info.avatar_url (optional)

URL to the package's avatar/icon image.

### variants (optional)

An array of platform-specific package configurations. This is the core configuration section of `tooth.json`.

lip processes variants in order, applying all that match the current platform. When multiple variants match, their configurations are merged.

Note: For platform compatibility checks, lip ignores variants using glob patterns. To support multiple platforms, define separate variants for each, even if they're empty.

### variants[].label (optional)

The label for this variant. Users can install a specific variant by label with `lip install <tooth>#<label>@<version>`. Should either match `^[a-z0-9]+(_[a-z0-9]+)*$ or be a glob pattern. If omitted or empty, the variant is considered the default.

For a variant label to be recognized, there must be at least one variant with a non-globbed label defined in the variants array. Glob patterns in label fields only take effect when their corresponding non-globbed labels are also defined. For example:

- Having only `label_*` does not indicate support for any label
- To support `label_a` and `label_b`, you need either:
  - Two separate variants with exact labels
  - One variant with exact label and another with `label_*`

### variants[].platform (optional)

The target platform for this variant. Valid values:

- `linux-arm64`
- `linux-x64`
- `osx-arm64`
- `osx-x64`
- `win-arm64`
- `win-x64`
- Glob patterns (e.g., `linux-*`)

For platform variant to be recognized, there must be at least one non-globbed platform variant defined in the variants array. Glob patterns in platform fields only take effect when their corresponding non-globbed platforms are also defined. For example:

- Having only `linux-*` does not indicate support for any Linux platform
- To support `linux-x64` and `linux-arm64`, you need either:
  - Two separate variants with exact platforms
  - One variant with exact platform and another with `linux-*`

If omitted or empty, the variant is considered platform-agnostic, i.e. always current platform.

### variants[].dependencies (optional)

Package dependencies, specified as key-value pairs. Keys are package identifiers (optionally with subdirectory paths), and values are version constraints.

Examples:

Keys:

- `github.com/futrime/example-package`
- `github.com/futrime/example-package#subpath`

Version constraints:

- Exact: `1.0.0`
- Range: `>=0.1.0 <1.0.0`

Version parsing uses [WalkerCodeRanger/semver](https://github.com/WalkerCodeRanger/semver).

### variants[].assets (optional)

Defines how package files should be handled.

### variants[].assets[].type (required)

The asset type:

- `self`: Files from the package itself
- `tar`: TAR archive
- `tgz`: Gzipped TAR archive
- `uncompressed`: Single uncompressed file
- `zip`: ZIP archive

### variants[].assets[].urls (optional)

Download URLs for the asset, tried in order. For `self` type assets, this should be empty.

### variants[].assets[].placements (optional)

Rules for placing files in the workspace. Accepts an array of placement rules.

### variants[].assets[].placements[].type (required)

Placement type:

- `file`: Single file placement
- `dir`: Directory placement

Note: `uncompressed` assets only support `file` type placement.

### variants[].assets[].placements[].src (required)

Source path specification:

- For `uncompressed` assets: Leave empty (`""`)
- For `file` type: File path or glob pattern (matched directories are ignored, files are flattened)
- For `dir` type: Directory path (preserves structure)

### variants[].assets[].placements[].dest (required)

Destination path:

- For file placement: Target file path
- For directory/glob placement: Target directory path

### variants[].preserve_files (optional)

Array of paths or glob patterns for files to keep during uninstallation.

### variants[].remove_files (optional)

Array of paths or glob patterns for files to remove during uninstallation. This will override `preserve_files` settings.

### variants[].scripts (optional)

Commands to execute in the workspace. Define as key-value pairs where keys are script names and values are arrays of commands to execute in order. If more than matched variants define the same script, only the last one is used even if the script is not defined, i.e. you are always recommended to define scripts as late as possible.

Built-in script hooks (all values are string arrays):

- `pre_install`: Before installation
- `install`: After file placement
- `post_install`: After installation
- `pre_pack`: Before packaging (only applies to default variant)
- `post_pack`: After packaging (only applies to default variant)
- `pre_uninstall`: Before uninstallation
- `uninstall`: After file removal
- `post_uninstall`: After uninstallation

Custom scripts can be run using `lip run <script>`. Custom script names should match `^[a-z0-9]+(_[a-z0-9]+)*$` and also expect arrays of commands as values.
