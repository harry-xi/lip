# Installation

You can install lip by following the instructions below.

## lip CLI

**lip** is a standalone executable, so installation isnâ€™t always necessary. Simply download the latest version from [here](https://github.com/futrime/lip/releases/latest). However, we do offer scripts and installers for those who prefer a more conventional setup.

For Linux and macOS, we provide installation scripts. Just run the appropriate command below and follow the on-screen instructions:

```shell
# For Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futrime/lip/HEAD/scripts/install_linux.sh | sh
```

```shell
# For macOS
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/futrime/lip/HEAD/scripts/install_macos.sh | sh
```

For Windows, download either `lip-cli-win-x64-en-US.msi` (for English) or `lip-cli-win-x64-zh-CN.msi` (for Chinese) from [this page](https://github.com/futrime/lip/releases/latest). Run the installer and follow the prompts to set up **lip**.

## lip GUI
